# Request Header Microservice API

This is a simple Node.js API service. When the API is properly used it returns JSON data about the user including: ip address, software and language that is obtained through the request header.

## Final Thoughts

This was very similiar to my last microservice project (Unix Timestamp Microservice). Deployment and configuration was much easier the second time around!
